# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Deep Learning for Heart Disease Prediction
This repository implements a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of a person developing heart disease. This model utilizes patient data to learn patterns and relationships that may indicate an increased risk.
Key Features:
•	Predictive Model: A deep learning architecture specifically designed for heart disease prediction. (Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Approach Based on BLSTM and BGRU).
•	Data Preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning, formatting, and preparing patient data for the model.
•	Training: Code for training the model on a labeled dataset of heart disease cases.
•	Evaluation: Methods for evaluating the model's performance, including metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Benefits:
•	Early Detection: This model can potentially aid in early detection of heart disease, allowing for preventative measures.
•	Improved Diagnosis: The model can be a valuable tool alongside other diagnostic methods for healthcare professionals.
Getting Started:
This repository includes instructions on how to set up the environment, run the model, and interpret the results.
Further Enhancements:
•	Integration with a user interface for easy data input and prediction visualization.
•	Exploration of different deep learning architectures for potentially improved performance.
•	Implementation of techniques for handling imbalanced datasets.
